Brain Tumor Detection using VGG-16 CNN
This project explores the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and the VGG-16 architecture to detect brain tumors from MRI images. The goal is to improve brain tumor diagnosis using deep learning techniques.

Dataset
The dataset consists of MRI images of patients with and without brain tumors. The dataset is preprocessed by resizing and normalization of the images, and filtering to improve image quality. The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

Model
The VGG-16 architecture is used as the base model, with additional layers added for classification. Several CNN models with varying architectures are designed and trained on the dataset. The models are evaluated using cross-validation to assess their performance.

Results
The accuracy and loss of the models are plotted over the epochs to analyze the model performance. It is observed that the model accuracy showed an increase with an increase in the epochs, with few fluctuations in the graphs. It is also observed that the model is not overfitting or underfitting.

Conclusion
The project demonstrates the potential for CNN-based approaches to improve brain tumor diagnosis. The VGG-16 architecture, combined with additional layers for classification, achieves high accuracy in tumor detection. The project provides insights into the use of deep learning techniques for medical imaging analysis.
